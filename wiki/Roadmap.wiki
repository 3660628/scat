#summary This page sumarizes the steps to follow and the main milestones of the project
#labels Phase-Implementation,Phase-Design,Phase-Requirements

= Immediate milestones =
  * StringFieldMorphs are not editable. We should either fix them or use EntryFieldMorphs instead
  * InputEventSensor behaves very differently than it used to. Many things are broken because of it
  * Fix encodings
  * Layouts of most DialogBoxMorphs are broken

= "Would be awesome if" milestones =
  * Automating all installation steps, so that the right files are downloaded and unpacked where needed upon loading Scat from monticello
  * Porting the current project to Pharo 1.2.1, which is not trivial because:
    * Morphic hierarchy changed quite a lot
    * isPartsBin disappeared from the Morphic instance methods library

= Mandatory but hard to accomplish milestones =
  * Getting the scripts to actually do something

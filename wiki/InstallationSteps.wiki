= Scratch for Pharo: Installation Steps =

  * Download a Pharo 1.1.1 One Click package with CogVM from: [https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/download.php/27524/Pharo-1.1.1-OneClickCogVM.zip here].
,,* WARNING * This process will modify some base Morphic classes and methods from the system, so please use a fresh image!,,
  * Dowload the following package: [http://download.scratch.mit.edu/source-code/ScratchSkin1.4.zip ScratchSkin1.4.zip]

  * Unzip the previous package into the same directory where the Pharo image lies (i.e. {{{Pharo-1.1.1-OneClick/Contents/Resources}}})

  * Load the nscratch package from the following Monticello repository:
{{{
MCHttpRepository
   location: 'http://www.squeaksource.com/nscratch'
   user: ''
   password: ''
}}}

  * Run the following code from a Workspace:
{{{
ScratchFrameMorph new startup openInWorld
}}}
  * A block browser and canvas should open. Some things work, some don’t...

= Getting the plugins working =
If you wish to have the camera (and some other things) working, you'll need to download the original Scratch plugins and include them in the root folder of the Pharo package.

These are feely available [http://download.scratch.mit.edu/source-code/ScratchPluginSrc1.4.zip here]. Just download this package and unzip it in your Pharo root folder.

= Extra steps for GNU/Linux users =
To get the camera working in GNU/Linux you'll need to be using a later CogVM build than the included in the OneClick package. You can find them all [http://www.mirandabanda.org/files/Cog/VM/ here].

At the moment, the last CogVM is [http://www.mirandabanda.org/files/Cog/VM/VM.r2382/coglinux.tgz this one].

Unzip the coglinux.tgz package and perform the following operations:
{{{
cp coglinux/* Pharo.app/Contents/Linux
mv Pharo.app/Contents/Linux/squeak Pharo.app/Contents/Linux/squeakvm
cp coglinux/lib/squeak/3.9-7/* Pharo.app/Contents/Linux
}}}

= ToDo =
We are planning to automate all this process, so that upon loading the scat package from Squeaksource, all required external files are automatically downloaded and unpacked where needed.
